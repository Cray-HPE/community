# Architecture Special Interest Group

The Architecture SIG maintains and evolves the design principles of CSM, and provides a consistent body of expertise necessary to ensure architectural consistency over time.

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Architecture Special Interest Group.

## Architecture and API Governance

Establishing and documenting design principles, documenting and evolving the system architecture, reviewing, curating, and documenting new extension patterns

Establishing and documenting conventions for system and user-facing APIs, define and operate the APl review process, final API implementation consistency validation, co-own top-level API directories with API machinery; maintaining, evolving, and enforcing the deprecation policy

* [CSM Design and Architecture](/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/architecture.md)
* [Design principles](/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/principles.md)
* [API conventions](/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md)
* [API Review process](/blob/master/sig-architecture/api-review-process.md)
* [Deprecation policy]()

Please see the [API Reviews]() tracking board to follow the work of this sub-project. Please reach out to the chairs if you are interested in joining this effort.

## Enhancement Proposals

Enhancement proposals (KEPs) are used to propose and communicate changes to sub-projects of SIG-Architecture. Following the EP process is mandatory for all enhancements.

* Answers to our FAQs can be found here [FAQs](https://github.com/cray-hpe/enhancements/tree/master/eps#faqs) 
* Full details of the EP process can be found in [EP-1](https://github.com/cray-hpe/enhancements/blob/master/eps/0001-enhancement-proposal-process.md)
* Please follow the EP template available at [EP Template](https://github.com/cray-hpe/enhancements/blob/master/eps/NNNN-ep-template/README.md) for the enhancement proposal.
* Progress of EPs can be tracked on our github project board at [Enhancements](https://github.com/cray-hpe/enhancements/projects/4)

## Production Readiness

Defining and documenting the processes for ensuring production readiness of new and
promoted features, as well as producing tooling to enforce those processes.
