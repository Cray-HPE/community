Notes from Shasta CSM Operations SIG chair kick-off

# Mundae To-do’s:

1) Survey the labs and DoD and establish existing bands of operational metrics related to scheduled and unscheduled down time
	a) NERSC: Scheduled time needs 95% availability, Unscheduled time needs 80% availability
2) Survey the CSM consumers to establish common capabilities for things like telemetry ingestion, service level KPI metrics


2) Reconcile the existing metrics / KPI’s with the general model as defined internally and articulated in the PDF pulled from the internal wiki page

3) NERSC stretch goal is continuous availability

4) LANL has also indicated an interest in driving to zero-downtime.


# Top 5 SIG OPS Roadmap Objectives

#1 Publish a formal operational model with SLO/SLA structure that realistically accommodates physical footprint realties, etc.

#2 Profile existing operational capabilities and expected availability over the coming year
	a) Formalize
		- Install benchmarks
		- Update benchmarks
		- Operational telemetry

#3 Catalog the KPI’s and publish them….(not in the admin guide)
	a) Publish alert catalog that is the base universal one

#4 Assess the existing physical footprint and rationalize it with the SLO bands

#5 Develop and publish a closed loop fault resolution model and architecture based on KPI catalog and know operational dimensions


Note: Needs to be a feedback loop (ideally something that is based on automation) where CSM operators can implement and share additional telemetry and other operational configurations with Cray HPE and the community.

Note: We need to categorize the functional dimensions do we want to articulate, measure and provide remediation for
- Cooling
- Power
- BMC/hardware
- CSM
- Management Network
- HSN / Streaming Telemetry
- Storage
- External Network Connectivity


The topic of an Install dashboard was discussed. This is an interesting idea, and would be great if it could serve for both install and ongoing update rollout……
