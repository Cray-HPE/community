# CRAY / HPE OSS Community
---
Welcome to the Cray /HPE open source community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the community - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

To learn more about the project structure and organization, please refer to Project Governance information.

# COMMUNICATING
---
The communication page lists communication channels like chat, issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

For more specific topics, try a SIG.

# GOVERNANCE
---
Note that this repository is loosely modeled on the kubernetes open governance repository at https://github.com/kubernetes/community.  The goal is to apply the similar governance within the Cray / HPE community.  Phase 1 will seed the governance and Phase 2 will expand participation.

There will be two phases for the rollout of governance for the Cray / HPE community:

### Phase 1 
Our initial model will be very lean and simple. Community participants may submit PR's against any one of the published repositories. Once the PR is submitted, the Cray internal engineering management for that component/repo will review the PR and determine its suitability. Accepted PR's will be merged to master and become part of a subsequent release within the context of release cadence as it exists as of November 2020. Decisions regarding community contributions to a given repository will be at the sole discretion of the Cray engineering organization during this phase.

### Phase 2
We expect the community to grow over time and the span of open sourced projects to grow. As participation grows we will adopt a governance structure that is similar in nature and structure to CNCF projects such as Kubernetes.

This means decision making can and will become more decentralized in nature. However, in some cases, particularly where there are hardware level integration and dependency dimension it is likely that HPE will retain final discretion related to accpetance of contributions. 

In general we will look to develop steering committees for a given project, SIG's and in some cases User and temporary working groups, as appropriate to the situation.

Details for both Phase 1 and 2 can be found in the governance.md file in this repository.

There is no formal timeline for the transition from Phae 1 to Phase 2 governance model, as we envision it being an ongoing evolutionary process.
