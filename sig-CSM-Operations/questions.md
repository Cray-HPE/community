# Operations Site Survey

1) Do you quantify availability the same across your entire system, or, do certain nodes get measured differently than others?

2) What does it mean for a node or set of nodes to be considered available?

3) Do you have a formal SLA regarding the availability (as defined in the above two questions) of your system, or, is it less formal such as "best effort" availability?

4) What monitoring tools/utilities do you currently use to support your operations?

5) Are these tools generalized to your entire site, or, are they specific to certain systems?

6) Do you archive monitoring data generated by your system(s) for later use?

7) What are the primary use cases for your monitoring data?

8) How does your alerting infrastructure primarily notify you of issues?

9) Are the alerts you get usually the result of failures, or, do you also have alerts for potential failures?

10) Have you utilized any of the Shasta APIs in your monitoring or operations frameworks? 

11) Thinking about the above questions specifically regarding Shasta: what works and what could work better?
