*This is a Work in Progress*, documenting approximately how we have been operating up to this point.

# Principles

The Cray/HPE community adheres to the following principles:
* Open: Cray/HPE is open source. See repository guidelines below.
* Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
* Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. See SIG governance, below.
* Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, [scope], and [design principles].

# Code of Conduct

The Cray/HPE community abides by the [Cray/HPE code of conduct]. Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

As a member of the Cray/HPE project, you represent the project and your fellow contributors.
We value our community tremendously and we'd like to keep cultivating a friendly and collaborative
environment for our contributors and users. We want everyone in the community to have
[positive experiences].

Working Groups
We need community rallying points to facilitate discussions/work regarding topics that are short-lived or that span multiple functioanl domains.

Working groups are primarily used to facilitate topics of discussion that are in scope for Cray/HPE but that cross SIG lines. If a set of folks in the community want to get together and discuss a topic, they can do so without forming a Working Group.

See working group governance for more details about forming and disbanding Working Groups.

Working groups are documented in sigs.yaml.

Committees
Some topics, such as Security or Code of Conduct, require discretion. Whereas SIGs are voluntary groups which operate in the open and anyone can join, Committees do not have open membership and do not always operate in the open. The steering committee can form committees as needed, for bounded or unbounded duration. Membership of a committee is decided by the steering committee, however, all committee members must be community members. Like a SIG, a committee has a charter and a chair, and will report to the steering committee periodically, and to the community as makes sense, given the charter.

User groups
Some topics have long term relevance to large groups of Cray/HPE users, but do not have clear deliverables or ownership of parts of the Cray/HPE code base. As such they are neither good fits for SIGs or Working Groups. An example of such a topic might be continuous delivery to Cray/HPE.

Though their central goal is not a deliverable piece of work, as contributing members of the community user groups are expected to work with SIGs to either identify friction or usability issues that need to be addressed, or to provide or improve documentation in their area of expertise. However these activities are covered under general code contributions to the relevant SIGs (e.g. SIG Docs) rather than as part of the user group. These contributions are expected to be more incremental and ad-hoc versus the more targeted output of a user group.

User groups function as a centralized resource to facilitate communication and discovery of information related to the topic of the user group. User groups should not undertake to produce any deliverable, instead they should form working groups under the auspices of some SIG for such work. Likewise they shouldn't take ownership of anything in the Cray/HPE process, as that is a role for SIGs. All user group chairs, and others that hold leadership positions within a user group must be community members.

See user group governance for more details about forming and disbanding User Groups.

To facilitate discoverability and engagement, user groups are documented in sigs.yaml

Community Group Annual Reports
As you can see in the descriptions above, the project is robust with diverse groups of contributors and their varying degrees of expected communications.

The annual community group health check will establish an opportunity for deeper dialogue and broader communication across the chairs of each group and the Steering Committee. By including this reporting with the existing community meeting structure, we can focus on the goals outlined in the Annual Report doc.

Cross-project Communication and Coordination
While most work shouldnâ€™t require expensive coordination with other SIGs, there will be efforts (features, refactoring, etc.) that cross SIG boundaries. In this case, it is expected that the SIGs coordinate with each other and come to mutually agreed solutions. In some cases, it may make sense to form a Working Group for joint work. Cross-SIG coordination will naturally require more time and implies a certain amount of overhead. This is intentional to encourage changes to be well encapsulated whenever possible.

On the other hand, several SIGs do have project-wide impact, for example Release, Testing, and API Machinery. Even those that do not may sometimes need to make changes or impose new processes or conventions that affect other SIGs. In these cases, project-wide communication processes will need to be followed. For example, proposals with project-wide impact will need to be announced more broadly, with the opportunity for members of other SIGs to provide feedback and guidance. However, the SIG that owns the area, according to its charter, will own the decision. In the case of extended debate or deadlock, decisions may be escalated to the Steering Committee, which is expected to be uncommon.

The [KEP process] is being developed as a way to facilitate definition, agreement and communication of efforts that cross SIG boundaries. SIGs are encouraged to use this process for larger efforts. This process is also available for smaller efforts within a SIG.

Repository guidelines
All new repositories under Cray/HPE github orgs should follow the process outlined in the Cray/HPE repository guidelines.
