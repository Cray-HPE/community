# Values

The board and TSC share a set of common values that guide interaction between member organizations, interpersonal relationships, and inform decision making.
We work in the open
Public decisions allow members and non-members alike to cooperate in accordance with these values.  Public decision-making allows the community to understand the tradeoffs inherent in any tough decision.  It builds trust and encourages participation.  By default, all documents should be public and all software should be open.

## Distribution is better than centralization
An international project of this scale is only viable through high-trust and high-visibility distribution of work, which includes delegation of authority, decision making, technical design, code ownership, and documentation. Distributed asynchronous ownership, collaboration, communication and decision making are the cornerstones of our world-wide community.

## Community over product or member organization
We are here as a community first. Our allegiance is to the intentional stewardship of the project for the benefit of all its members and users everywhere. We support working together publicly for the common goal of a vibrant interoperable ecosystem, providing an excellent experience for our users. Individuals gain status through work. Member organizations gain status through their commitments to support this community and fund the resources necessary for the project to operate.

## Inclusive is better than exclusive
Broadly successful and useful technologies require different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment. Community membership is a privilege, not a right. Community members earn leadership through effort, scope, quality, quantity, and duration of contributions. Our community respects the time and effort put into a discussion, regardless of where a contributor is on their growth path.

## Evolution is better than stagnation
Openness to new ideas and technological evolution make the project stronger. Continual improvement, servant leadership, mentorship, and respect are the foundations of our culture. Community leaders have a duty to find, sponsor, and promote new community members. Leaders should expect to step aside. Community members should expect to step up
