# CSM Design and Architecture

## Overview

Cray System Management (CSM) is a flexible platform for managing HPC systems from tens of compute nodes to tens of thousands.  It aims to provide declarative syntax and cloud-like API interactions for HPC administrators so they can provide job-centric security and performance to HPC users.  CSM also provides a set of primitives for security and tenancy that can be used by workload managers to give users more control over their own jobs without compromising the overall performance of the system.

## Scope

CSM aspires to be a general-purpose HPC system management platform with admin-servicable components.  Therefore, architecturally, we want CSM to be based on a collection of pluggable components and layers.

## Goals

## Architecture

### Undercloud

### Hardware Management Services

### System Images and Boot Services

### Tenancy and Partitioning

### Management Networking
