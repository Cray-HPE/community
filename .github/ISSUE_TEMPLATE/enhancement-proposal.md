**Internal References**

Use this section to reference bug reports or feature requests along with feedback on how the problem affects CSM users directly.  In order to remain concise, please use lists of links with brief descriptions where possible.

**External References**

Use this section to point to other software that has either dealt with or avoided similar problems.  Even though this is the external section, links to other CSM software are appropriate

**Proposed Solution(s)**

Briefly describe the main changes to CSM software involved in solving the problem.  If there are multiple paths under consideration, feel free to list them.  Links to external design documents are fine, but the level of detail needed is low.  We need to understand what is being proposed.  We do not need enough detail to implement.

**Impact of Action/Inaction**

What if we don't solve this problem at this point?

What impact is there beyond the problem statement if we fix the problem now?
