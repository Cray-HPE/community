__**Template Instructions**__

__All italicized text is placeholder and should be deleted__

__In most cases, each section should be less than a paragraph__

__The purpose is to explain why a change is needed and get general agreement/familiarity with the approach.  This is not a process for design-by-committee__


**Abstract**

__Delete this text and replace with a concise summary of the problem and proposed solution.__

**Problem Statement**

__Delete this text and replace it. From a customer point of view, explain how the system works today and what part of the customer experience needs improvement.__

**Internal References**

__Use this section to reference bug reports or feature requests along with feedback on how the problem affects CSM users directly.  In order to remain concise, please use lists of links with brief descriptions where possible.__

**External References**

__Use this section to point to other software that has either dealt with or avoided similar problems.  Even though this is the external section, links to other CSM software are appropriate.__

**Proposed Solution(s)**

__Briefly describe the main changes to CSM software involved in solving the problem.  If there are multiple paths under consideration, feel free to list them.  Links to external design documents are fine, but the level of detail needed is low.  We need to understand what is being proposed.  We do not need enough detail to implement.__

**Impact of Action/Inaction**

__What if we don't solve this problem at this point?__

__What impact is there beyond the problem statement if we fix the problem now?__

**Further Information**

__Use this section for pertinent information and/or links to background information.__
