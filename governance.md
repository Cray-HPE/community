*This is a Work in Progress*

# Principles

The Cray/HPE community adheres to the following principles:
* Open: Cray/HPE is open source. See repository guidelines below.
* Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
* Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. See SIG governance, below.
* Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, [scope], and [design principles].

# Code of Conduct

The Cray/HPE community abides by the [Cray/HPE code of conduct]. Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

As a member of the Cray/HPE community, you represent the project and your fellow contributors.
We value our community and are committed to cultivating a friendly and collaborative
environment for our contributors and users. We want everyone in the community to have
positive experiences.

## OSS Phase 1 Governance

While ultimate go / no-go decisions regarding a given PR or design change, etc will remain with Cray-HPE, we expect to begin the development and processes necessary to move us to a mainstream OSS project governance model.

## Special Interest  Groups
For Phase one we will form the following Special Interest Groups (SIG's) to provide natural rallying points around subject domain areas:

- [CSM Architecture](sig-CSM-Architecture/README.md)
- CSM Hardware Management
- [CSM Image and Configuration Management](sig-CSM-Image-Configuration-Management/README.md)
- CSM User Access and Experience
- CSM Security
- CSM Workload Management
- [CSM Multi-Tenancy](sig-CSM-Multi-Tenancy/README.md)
- [CSM Release Management](sig-CSM-Release-Management/README.md)

Each SIG is comprised of members from both Cray-HPE, private domain companies, and public domain customers and entities. All with a common purpose of advancing the project with respect to a specific topic, such as Workload management, Networking or Documentation. Our goal is to enable a distributed decision structure and code ownership, as well as providing focused forums for getting work done, making decisions, and onboarding new contributors. Every identifiable subpart of the project (e.g., github org, repository, subdirectory, API, test, issue, PR) is intended to be owned by some SIG.

Areas covered by SIGs may be vertically focused on particular components or functions, cross-cutting/horizontal, spanning many/all functional areas of the project, or in support of the project itself. Examples:

- Vertical: Network, Storage, Compute, Workload Scheduling
- Horizontal: Security, Scalability, Architecture
- Project: Testing, Release, Docs, PM, Contributor Experience

SIGs must have at least one and ideally two SIG chairs at any given time. SIG chairs are intended to be organizers and facilitators, responsible for the operation of the SIG and for communication and coordination with the other SIGs, the Steering Committee, and the broader community.

## Cross-Project Communication and Coordination - Working Groups

During Phase 1 We need community rallying points to facilitate discussions/work regarding topics that are short-lived or that span multiple functioanl domains.

Working groups are primarily used to facilitate topics of discussion that are in scope for CSM but that cross SIG lines. If a set of folks in the community want to get together and discuss a topic, they can do so without forming a Working Group.

Working Groups will be formed as needed or situations dictate. See working group governance for more details about forming and disbanding Working Groups. 

Working groups are documented in sigs.yaml.

## Repository guidelines
All new repository requests will be handled on a case by case basis during Phase 1 of the OSS transition. When we move to Phase 2, repository additions will follow a defined community process.
