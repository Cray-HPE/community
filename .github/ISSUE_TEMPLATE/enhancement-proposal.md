_Template Instructions_

_All italicized text is placeholder and should be deleted_

_In most cases, each section should be less than a paragraph_

_The purpose is to explain why a change is needed and get general agreement/familiarity with the approach.  This is not a process for design-by-committee._


## Abstract

_Delete this text and replace with a concise summary of the problem and proposed solution._

## Problem Statement

_From a customer point of view, explain how the system works today and what part of the customer experience needs improvement._

## Internal References

_Use this section to reference bug reports or feature requests along with feedback on how the problem affects CSM users directly.  In order to remain concise, please use lists of links with brief descriptions where possible._

## External References

_Use this section to point to other software that has either dealt with or avoided similar problems.  Even though this is the external section, links to other CSM software are appropriate._

## Proposed Solution(s)

_Briefly describe the main changes to CSM software involved in solving the problem.  If there are multiple paths under consideration, feel free to list them.  Links to external design documents are fine, but the level of detail needed is low.  We need to understand what is being proposed.  We do not need enough detail to implement._

## Impact of Action/Inaction

_What if we don't solve this problem at this point?_

_What impact is there beyond the problem statement if we fix the problem now?_

## Further Information

_Use this section for pertinent information and/or links to background information._

## Housekeeping

_All of this section is optional. If nothing is added here, remove the entire Housekeeping section._

### Comment Period

_Specify a date by which this proposal's comment period should close. In order to ensure that lack of review does not delay mission critical enhancements, the suggested comment period is at least 7 calendar days, not including major holidays/breaks. Use your best judgment. If this is not time critical specify a longer comment period or none at all._

_Comment period for this proposal shall close on [[July 28, 202X]]._
